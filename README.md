## Translations

Please review the translations [tips for Monero translators](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/translation-tips.md). And also make use of the glossaries availabe [here](https://translate.getmonero.org/dictionaries/monero/) and [here](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/tree/master/terminology-guides) to keep consistency along with other localized resources.

#### Follow this instructions to translate the subtitles to your native language:

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally (If you are not familiar with Github, check out this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)).
2. Make a copy of `monero-means-money-**edition**-eng.srt` and rename it to `monero-means-money-**edition**-pt_BR.srt`, changing the country code according to the list below.
3. It's easier to use a captioning software to edit the `.srt` file while preserving the timestamps.
  * There are plenty of options available and I use [Aegisub](http://www.aegisub.org/) which is open-source and runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Feel free to use one that fits your needs.
4. Open Aegisub and then open the file you created. In my example it's called `monero-means-money-workgroup-pt_BR.srt`
5. Select the menu option `Subtitle` and then click on `Translation Assistant...`
6. Start translating the sentences as they show-up and press `Enter` to move to the next one.
7. Once you are done (or tired), save your progress by pressing `Ctrl+S`.
8. When you finish the whole file on Aegisub, select the menu option `File` and then click on `Export Subtitles...`. Don't forget to select `.srt`file extension before saving.
9. Always remember to add a message to the commit with the **document name, language and a small description of your work** (e.g. `monero movie workgroup pt_BR translation`, etc).
10. Submit a Pull Request and let other contributors review your work if possible.
11. Happy contributing! And if you need assistance, get in touch with `netrik182`on matrix, IRC and Wire.
